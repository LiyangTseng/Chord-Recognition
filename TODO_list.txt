TODO:
1.failure case study
    demonstrate why some accuracy is bad(working with kevin)
2.transfer learning
    survey paper about transfer learning on chord recognition 
    DONE: N/A 
3.source separation
    try https://github.com/deezer/spleeter, see if it is the best on MUSDB18. If so, use it for preprocessing.
    BEFORE  average accuracy: 0.6581755597431462
            median accuracy: 0.6794336876606979
4.neural network calibration
    see if trained data is imbalanced, can count the number on each class 
5.leaderboard
    submit and see if the result are better than baseline
    manually calculate the overall accuracy
6.feature disentanglement
    see if this can surpass #1
    ways to improve BTC
7.add other given features to train the model
