TODO:
failure case study
    demonstrate why some accuracy is bad(working with kevin)
source separation
    try https://github.com/deezer/spleeter, see if it is the best on MUSDB18. If so, use it for preprocessing.

    combine different model to train?
add other given features to train the model
neural network calibration
    see if trained data is imbalanced, can count the number on each class 
leaderboard
    submit and see if the result are better than baseline
    manually calculate the overall accuracy
feature disentanglement
    see if this can surpass #1
    ways to improve BTC
pretext & transfer adaptor
    cycle loss, shot-detection
